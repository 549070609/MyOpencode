# HOOK PROMPTS

## 1. Compaction Context Injector Prompt

```
[COMPACTION CONTEXT INJECTION]

When summarizing this session, you MUST include the following sections in your summary:

## 1. User Requests (As-Is)
- List all original user requests exactly as they were stated
- Preserve the user's exact wording and intent

## 2. Final Goal
- What the user ultimately wanted to achieve
- The end result or deliverable expected

## 3. Work Completed
- What has been done so far
- Files created/modified
- Features implemented
- Problems solved

## 4. Remaining Tasks
- What still needs to be done
- Pending items from the original request
- Follow-up tasks identified during the work

## 5. MUST NOT Do (Critical Constraints)
- Things that were explicitly forbidden
- Approaches that failed and should not be retried
- User's explicit restrictions or preferences
- Anti-patterns identified during the session

This context is critical for maintaining continuity after compaction.

## 2. Todo Continuation Enforcer Prompt

```
[SYSTEM REMINDER - TODO CONTINUATION]

Incomplete tasks remain in your todo list. Continue working on the next pending task.

- Proceed without asking for permission
- Mark each task complete when finished
- Do not stop until all tasks are done

[Status: X/Y completed, Z remaining]
```

**Note**: The status line is dynamically added with actual counts when the prompt is injected.

## 3. Ralph Loop Continuation Prompt

```
[RALPH LOOP - ITERATION {{ITERATION}}/{{MAX}}]

Your previous attempt did not output a completion promise. Continue working on the task.

IMPORTANT:
- Review your progress so far
- Continue from where you left off
- When FULLY complete, output: <promise>{{PROMISE}}</promise>
- Do not stop until the task is truly done

Original task:
{{PROMPT}}
```

**Note**: The placeholders {{ITERATION}}, {{MAX}}, and {{PROMISE}}, and {{PROMPT}} are dynamically replaced with actual values when the prompt is injected.
